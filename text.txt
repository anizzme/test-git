1.working directory(here- test-prj) ---> 2.stagging area(where all the code goes) ---> 3.local repo(from stagging area to local repo. Means we are ready everythng inside prj to remote repo) --> 4.remote repo 
test-prj --- use the command git add and the file name to add into stagging area ---to move from stagging area to local repo we use git commit --- git push to add inot remote repo 
test-prj ---? git add ---> git commit --->git push
In staging area- file is tracked and in working directoyr it is not tracked


In a git folder a file can have 2 states- tracked and untracked
git status can be used in working dir and stagging area
tracked- git knows we added some files to git repo
if we dont add something to stagging area- untracked
git init--> git add/ git restore-- git status to check the status git diff to see the changes made
